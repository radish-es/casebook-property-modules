#### The *Land Titles Clarification Act*

On November 24, 2017 Mr. Downey filed an application for land titles clarification under the *Land Titles Clarification Act* with respect to a property at 39 Beals Crescent in North Preston. The history, context and purpose of that legislation has been reviewed in detail by my colleague Justice Bodurtha in *Beals v. Nova Scotia (Attorney General)*, 2020 NSSC 60 (N.S. S.C.).

African Nova Scotians have been subjected to racism for hundreds of years in this province. It is embedded within the systems that govern how our society operates. That is a fundamental historical fact and an observation of present reality.

That has real implications for things like land ownership. Residents in African Nova Scotian communities are more likely to have unclear title to land on which they may have lived for many generations. That is because in those communities, informal arrangements were more common. Financial and other obstacles made it less likely that people in those communities would retain lawyers and surveyors to research title, register deeds or wills, or to survey boundaries. People may have lived on land for generations without having title registered. No one else might claim it and it may be that no one in the community disputes their entitlement to it. But they still have no formal title.

The legislation under which Mr. Downey made his application was intended to provide people who live in designated areas with a simpler and less expensive way to clarify title to their property. North Preston is one of those designated areas.

Under the legislation a person who resides in Nova Scotia and claims to own land in one of the designated areas can make an application for a certificate of claim. That application must contain a description of the land so that it can be identified and distinguished from other land. The application must include a concise statement of the facts on which the person bases the claim for ownership, and it must name other people who have occupied the land or who have claimed ownership or an interest in the land. That application must be accompanied by an abstract of title, a statutory declaration attesting to the history of the occupation of the land and a statement showing the names of anyone who holds any form of charge on the land, like a mortgage or judgment. It could be described as an alternative to the more cumbersome, expensive and time-consuming process of the *Quieting Titles Act* R.S.N.S., c. 382. One of the issues here is just how much more expedited that process should be in order to achieve the purposes of the legislation.

Section 4(4) of the *Land Titles Clarification Act* provides that the Minister of Lands and Forestry may require the applicant to provide any information that the Minister desires and may require the applicant to verify any material or information accompanying the application. That provides the Minister with considerable discretion in terms of the information that may be required.

The certificate of claim is the first step toward obtaining a certificate of title. Section 5(1) says that when it appears from the application that the “applicant is entitled to the lot of land” the Minister may issue a certificate of claim. If the Minister cannot determine whether the applicant is entitled to the land the matter is referred to a commissioner to examine the claim. That commissioner, who is a barrister appointed by the Minister, recommends issuance of a certificate or provides reasons for not making the recommendation. When the commissioner recommends issuing a certificate of claim, the Minister may issue one without making further inquiries.

Once a certificate of claim is issued the Minister is required to register it. The public is notified through publication in a newspaper. The certificate of claim then places an onus on those who also claim an interest in the land. Holders of liens, mortgages and judgments affecting the land, which have been in place for more than 2 years and on which no payments or written acknowledgments have been made for two years or more are required to take steps to enforce the security. Once notice has been provided, they have 3 months to enforce it. If steps are not taken the lien or charge on the property, it is deemed to no longer be binding on the land. Others, who claim an interest in the land can file a notice with the Minister within 60 days of the certificate of claim having been filed. That person then has 60 more days within which to start an action in the Supreme Court for a declaration that the interest they claim is valid. If that action has not been started the Minister will grant a certificate of title to the applicant.

So, the certificate of claim starts a process by which other interested parties are then required to take some action to either enforce the registered charge on the property if they have one, or make a formal claim for a declaration of an interest in the land. If no claims are made within the time limits set out in the act, the Minister is required to grant the certificate of title. The applicant then has title to the land in fee simple.

The issuing of a certificate of claim is then more than an acknowledgement that a claim has been made. It grants that claim status as a presumptive interest in the land which others are then required to contest.

The Minster “may” issue a certificate of claim, when it appears that the applicant is “entitled to the lot of land”. The Minister then has to make a determination of whether the applicant appears to be “entitled”. The legislation does not set out the grounds upon which the Minister can make that determination and does not provide any definition of entitlement. What does it mean to be “entitled” to land, within the context of this remedial legislation?
